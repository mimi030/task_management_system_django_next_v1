## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.x (for Django backend)
- Django 5.0.x (with Django REST framework)
- Next.js 14.x (for the frontend)
- Node.js v18.17.x and npm/yarn (for managing Next.js dependencies)
- SQLite or any supported database (for Django database)

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mimi030/task_management_system_django_next_v1.git
   cd task_management_system_django_next_v1/task_management_system
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the required environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`).

4. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

4. Start the frontend server:
   If you are using npm
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or if you are using yarn
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
